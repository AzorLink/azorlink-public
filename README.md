> **Public repository** for AzorLink: documentation, architecture and **safe placeholders** (no private automation logic, no tokens, no production rules).

## 🌊 What is AzorLink?

AzorLink helps local lodging owners in the Azores automate guest communication through **WhatsApp** — using the tool everyone already has.

It is designed for real host problems:
- repetitive FAQs (Wi-Fi, parking, arrival time, directions)
- check-in instructions and house rules
- local recommendations (restaurants, viewpoints, trails)
- multilingual guests (PT / EN / FR / DE)

## ✅ What's included in this repo (public-safe)

- `frontend/` — Next.js dashboard **skeleton** (UI placeholders)
- `src/` — backend **skeleton** (placeholders only)
- `docs/` — documentation + screenshots placeholders
- `architecture/` — high-level architecture notes and diagrams (public-safe)
- `ROADMAP.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`

## 🔒 What's NOT included (by design)

To protect the product and client security, this public repo **does not contain**:
- WhatsApp / 360Dialog tokens or credentials
- real automation rules, templates, or intent engine logic
- production database configuration or infra secrets

If you need access to the private core for partnership or hiring evaluation, contact the author.

## 🧱 Repository structure

client data, private automation logic or production credentials.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

See [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md).

## 🌍 Why the Azores?

Born and raised in Faial, I've seen how small hosts get overloaded during peak season: hundreds of repeated questions, multilingual guests, manual replies — all day, every day.

AzorLink aims to modernize that experience with simple automation that fits local reality.
