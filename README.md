## 🌍 Why the Azores?

Built with the reality of Azorean hosts in mind:
- **Seasonal overload** — Peak tourism periods create communication bottlenecks
- **Repetitive questions** — Same FAQs from guests every season
- **Multilingual guests** — Visitors from Portugal, UK, France, Germany, and beyond
- **Simple tools** — Solutions that work with what people already use — **WhatsApp**

AzorLink bridges the gap between traditional hospitality and modern automation, designed specifically for the unique needs of Azorean tourism.
