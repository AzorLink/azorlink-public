# Backend Source (Demo Placeholder)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: This directory contains **DEMO PLACEHOLDERS only**.

## What's Here

This `src/` folder shows a **simplified backend structure** for demonstration purposes in the public repository.

## What's NOT Here

- ❌ Production backend code (uses NestJS, not included)
- ❌ Real business logic
- ❌ Database connections
- ❌ WhatsApp/360Dialog integration
- ❌ Automation rules or intent engine
- ❌ Production configuration

## Structure

The files here use Express.js as a **simple example** to show:
- Basic folder structure
- Layered architecture concept
- TypeScript patterns

**This is NOT the production stack.** The real backend uses NestJS with a different architecture.

## Purpose

This code exists to:
- ✅ Show project structure
- ✅ Demonstrate architecture concepts
- ✅ Provide public-safe examples
- ❌ **NOT to be run or deployed**

## Note on Express.js

Express.js is used here only as a **simple placeholder** to demonstrate structure. The production backend uses **NestJS**, which is not included in this public repository.
